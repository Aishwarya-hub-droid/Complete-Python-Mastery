### Assignment 1: Primitive Data Types

1. **Integer Operations:**
   - Create two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign integer values to them.
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on these numbers.
   - Print the results.

2. **Float Operations:**
   - Create two variables, `float1` and `float2`, and assign float values to them.
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on these numbers.
   - Print the results.

3. **String Manipulation:**
   - Create a string variable, `str1`, and assign a text value to it.
   - Use string concatenation to combine it with another string.
   - Use string repetition to repeat the string multiple times.
   - Print the final string.

4. **Boolean Operations:**
   - Create two boolean variables, `bool1` and `bool2`.
   - Implement logical AND, OR, and NOT operations on these boolean values.
   - Print the results.

### Assignment 2: Type Conversion

1. **Implicit Type Conversion:**
   - Create two variables, `num_int` (integer) and `num_float` (float).
   - Perform an operation that results in an implicit type conversion.
   - Print the types before and after the operation.

2. **Explicit Type Conversion:**
   - Create a float variable, `float_number`.
   - Convert it to an integer using the `int()` function.
   - Print both the float and integer values.

3. **String to Number Conversion:**
   - Create a string variable, `str_number`, containing a numeric value.
   - Convert it to an integer and a float.
   - Print the original string and the converted numeric values.

4. **Boolean to String Conversion:**
   - Create a boolean variable, `bool_value`.
   - Convert it to a string using the `str()` function.
   - Print the original boolean value and the converted string.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to comment their code explaining each step.
- Emphasize the importance of understanding data types and type conversion for writing efficient and bug-free code.
- Provide feedback on the correctness and clarity of the code.
- Encourage students to experiment with different scenarios to solidify their understanding.
