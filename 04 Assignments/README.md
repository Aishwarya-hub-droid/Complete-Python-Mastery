**Topic**: Data Types in Python
**Subject**: Python Programming
**Level**: Beginner
**Duration**: 1 Hour
**Total Marks**: 20

### Objective

* Understand different built-in data types in Python.
* Learn how to perform operations and type conversions.
* Practice writing simple programs using basic data types.

---

### Task 1: Identify the Data Types (5 Marks)

Write a Python program that prints the data type of each of the following variables:

```python
a = 10
b = 3.14
c = "Hello"
d = True
e = None
f = [1, 2, 3]
g = (4, 5, 6)
h = {'name': 'Pankaj', 'age': 25}
i = {1, 2, 3}
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Type of a is: <class 'int'>
Type of b is: <class 'float'>
...
```

---

### Task 2: Type Conversion (5 Marks)

Write a Python program to:

1. Convert an integer to float.
2. Convert a float to integer.
3. Convert a string to integer (input from user).
4. Convert a list to tuple.
5. Convert a tuple to list.

**Example:**

```python
x = 10
y = float(x)
print("Float value:", y)
```

---

### Task 3: Operations on Data Types (5 Marks)

Perform the following operations:

1. Concatenate two strings.
2. Add two integers.
3. Multiply a string with an integer.
4. Add two lists.
5. Slice a string and a list.

**Example:**

```python
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print(result)
```

---

### Task 4: Real-life Input and Output (5 Marks)

Create a Python program that:

* Takes user input for name (string), age (integer), and marks (float).
* Prints a message using those inputs.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter your name: Pankaj
Enter your age: 21
Enter your marks: 86.5

Hello Pankaj! You are 21 years old and scored 86.5 marks.
```
