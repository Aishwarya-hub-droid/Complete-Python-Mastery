### Assignment 3: If-Else Statements and Logical Operators

1. **Positive/Negative Number Checker:**
   - Write a program that takes a number as input.
   - Use an `if-else` statement to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - Print an appropriate message based on the condition.

2. **Even/Odd Number Checker:**
   - Write a program that takes an integer as input.
   - Use an `if-else` statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
   - Print the result.

3. **Leap Year Checker:**
   - Write a program that takes a year as input.
   - Use an `if-else` statement to check if the year is a leap year.
   - Print the result.

4. **Grade Calculator:**
   - Write a program that takes a student's score as input.
   - Use an `if-else` statement to assign a grade based on the score (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
   - Print both the score and the corresponding grade.

### Assignment 4: Logical Operators

1. **Age Category Classifier:**
   - Write a program that takes a person's age as input.
   - Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) in an `if-else` statement to classify the age into categories like "Child," "Teenager," "Adult," or "Senior."
   - Print the result.

2. **Password Strength Checker:**
   - Write a program that takes a password as input.
   - Use logical operators to check the strength of the password (e.g., length, inclusion of numbers, special characters).
   - Print a message indicating the strength.

3. **Number Range Checker:**
   - Write a program that takes a number as input.
   - Use logical operators to check if the number falls within specific ranges (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, 21-30).
   - Print the corresponding range.

4. **Voting Eligibility Checker:**
   - Write a program that takes a person's age as input.
   - Use logical operators to determine if the person is eligible to vote.
   - Print a message indicating eligibility.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Emphasize the importance of proper indentation in Python.
- Encourage experimentation with different values to verify the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on code readability and efficiency.
- Remind students to test their programs with various scenarios to ensure robustness.
