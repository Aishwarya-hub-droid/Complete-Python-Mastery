### Assignment 5: For Loops

1. **Sum of Numbers:**
   - Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
   - Print the result.

2. **Multiplication Table:**
   - Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints its multiplication table (up to 10) starting from 1 using a `for` loop.

3. **List Iteration:**
   - Create a list of your favorite fruits.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and print each fruit.

4. **Counting Characters:**
   - Write a program that takes a string as input.
   - Use a `for` loop to count and print the number of characters in the string.

### Assignment 6: While Loops

1. **Countdown Timer:**
   - Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints a countdown from that number to 1 using a `while` loop.

2. **Password Guessing Game:**
   - Choose a secret password and ask the user to guess it.
   - Use a `while` loop to continue prompting the user until they correctly guess the password.

3. **Even Number Generator:**
   - Write a program that generates and prints the first 5 even numbers starting from 1 using a `while` loop.

4. **Factorial Calculator:**
   - Write a program that takes an integer as input and calculates its factorial starting from 1 using a `while` loop.
   - Print the result.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to initialize loop variables properly and to use the appropriate loop control statements (`break` or `continue`) when necessary.
- Emphasize the importance of proper indentation in Python.
- Encourage experimentation with different values to verify the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on code readability and efficiency.
- Remind students to test their programs with various scenarios to ensure robustness.
