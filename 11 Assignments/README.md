### Assignment 7: Functions

1. **Sum Function:**
   - Write a function named `calculate_sum` that takes two parameters (a and b) and returns their sum.
   - Call the function with different values and print the results.

2. **Factorial Function:**
   - Write a function named `calculate_factorial` that takes an integer parameter (n) and returns its factorial.
   - Call the function with different values and print the results.

3. **Even/Odd Checker Function:**
   - Write a function named `is_even` that takes an integer as a parameter and returns `True` if it's even and `False` otherwise.
   - Call the function with different values and print the results.

### Assignment 8: Lists

1. **List Operations:**
   - Create a list of your favorite colors.
   - Write a function named `print_colors` that takes a list as a parameter and prints each color on a new line.
   - Call the function with your list.

2. **List Manipulation:**
   - Create a list of numbers.
   - Write a function named `square_numbers` that takes a list as a parameter and returns a new list containing the squares of each number.
   - Call the function with your list and print the results.

3. **List Sorting:**
   - Create a list of random numbers.
   - Write a function named `sort_numbers` that takes a list as a parameter and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in ascending order.
   - Call the function with your list and print the results.

### Assignment 9: Tuples

1. **Tuple Operations:**
   - Create a tuple of your favorite books.
   - Write a function named `print_books` that takes a tuple as a parameter and prints each book on a new line.
   - Call the function with your tuple.

2. **Tuple Concatenation:**
   - Create two tuples of numbers.
   - Write a function named `concatenate_tuples` that takes two tuples as parameters and returns a new tuple by concatenating them.
   - Call the function with your tuples and print the results.

3. **Tuple Unpacking:**
   - Create a tuple containing your name and age.
   - Write a function named `unpack_tuple` that takes a tuple as a parameter and prints the name and age separately.
   - Call the function with your tuple.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to call the functions with different values to test their implementations.
- Emphasize the importance of code readability and efficiency.
- Encourage experimentation with different scenarios to ensure the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on the usage of functions, lists, and tuples in their solutions.
