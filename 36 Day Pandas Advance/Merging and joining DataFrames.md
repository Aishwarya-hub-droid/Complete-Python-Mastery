# **Merging and Joining DataFrames in Pandas (with CSV files)**  

## **Introduction**  
When working with real-world datasets, you often need to combine data from multiple sources. Pandas provides powerful **merge** and **join** operations to help with this. In this tutorial, we'll explore different types of merges and joins using CSV files.  

## **Step 1: Understanding Merge and Join in Pandas**  
Pandas provides two main functions to combine datasets:  
- `pd.merge()` ‚Üí Used to combine DataFrames based on a common column (like SQL joins).  
- `.join()` ‚Üí Used when working with DataFrames that have an index-based key.

## **Step 2: Preparing Sample CSV Files**  
We'll create two CSV files:  

### **1. employees.csv (Employee details)**  
| Emp_ID | Name    | Dept_ID |  
|--------|--------|---------|  
| 101    | Alice  | 1       |  
| 102    | Bob    | 2       |  
| 103    | Charlie| 1       |  
| 104    | David  | 3       |  
| 105    | Eva    | NULL    |  

Save this data as `employees.csv`.  

---

### **2. departments.csv (Department details)**  
| Dept_ID | Dept_Name   |  
|---------|------------|  
| 1       | HR         |  
| 2       | IT         |  
| 3       | Finance    |  
| 4       | Marketing  |  

Save this data as `departments.csv`.  

---

## **Step 3: Load Data into Pandas DataFrames**  
We will load the CSV files using `pandas.read_csv()`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load Employee Data
employees = pd.read_csv("employees.csv")

# Load Department Data
departments = pd.read_csv("departments.csv")

print("Employees DataFrame:")
print(employees)

print("\nDepartments DataFrame:")
print(departments)
```

---

## **Step 4: Using `merge()` to Combine DataFrames**  
The `merge()` function in Pandas allows combining DataFrames based on a common column (`Dept_ID` in this case).  

### **4.1 Inner Join (Default)**
```python
merged_df = pd.merge(employees, departments, on="Dept_ID", how="inner")
print("\nInner Join Result:")
print(merged_df)
```
**Explanation:**  
- **Only common records** (matching `Dept_ID` in both DataFrames) are included.  
- Employees without a department and departments without employees are excluded.  

**Output:**  
| Emp_ID | Name    | Dept_ID | Dept_Name |  
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|  
| 101    | Alice  | 1       | HR        |  
| 102    | Bob    | 2       | IT        |  
| 103    | Charlie| 1       | HR        |  
| 104    | David  | 3       | Finance   |  

---

### **4.2 Left Join (All Employees, Even if No Department Assigned)**
```python
left_join_df = pd.merge(employees, departments, on="Dept_ID", how="left")
print("\nLeft Join Result:")
print(left_join_df)
```
**Explanation:**  
- **All employees** are included.  
- If an employee's `Dept_ID` is missing, `NaN` appears in `Dept_Name`.  

**Output:**  
| Emp_ID | Name    | Dept_ID | Dept_Name  |  
|--------|--------|---------|------------|  
| 101    | Alice  | 1       | HR         |  
| 102    | Bob    | 2       | IT         |  
| 103    | Charlie| 1       | HR         |  
| 104    | David  | 3       | Finance    |  
| 105    | Eva    | NULL    | NaN        |  

---

### **4.3 Right Join (All Departments, Even if No Employees)**
```python
right_join_df = pd.merge(employees, departments, on="Dept_ID", how="right")
print("\nRight Join Result:")
print(right_join_df)
```
**Explanation:**  
- **All departments** are included.  
- If a department has no employees, `NaN` appears in `Emp_ID` and `Name`.  

**Output:**  
| Emp_ID | Name    | Dept_ID | Dept_Name  |  
|--------|--------|---------|------------|  
| 101    | Alice  | 1       | HR         |  
| 102    | Bob    | 2       | IT         |  
| 103    | Charlie| 1       | HR         |  
| 104    | David  | 3       | Finance    |  
| NaN    | NaN    | 4       | Marketing  |  

---

### **4.4 Outer Join (All Employees and All Departments)**
```python
outer_join_df = pd.merge(employees, departments, on="Dept_ID", how="outer")
print("\nOuter Join Result:")
print(outer_join_df)
```
**Explanation:**  
- **All employees and all departments** are included.  
- If an employee lacks a department, `NaN` appears in `Dept_Name`.  
- If a department has no employees, `NaN` appears in `Emp_ID` and `Name`.  

**Output:**  
| Emp_ID | Name    | Dept_ID | Dept_Name  |  
|--------|--------|---------|------------|  
| 101    | Alice  | 1       | HR         |  
| 102    | Bob    | 2       | IT         |  
| 103    | Charlie| 1       | HR         |  
| 104    | David  | 3       | Finance    |  
| 105    | Eva    | NULL    | NaN        |  
| NaN    | NaN    | 4       | Marketing  |  

---

## **Step 5: Using `.join()` for Index-Based Merging**
Pandas `.join()` method is useful when merging DataFrames using indexes.

### **5.1 Convert `Dept_ID` to Index and Use `.join()`**
```python
employees.set_index("Dept_ID", inplace=True)
departments.set_index("Dept_ID", inplace=True)

joined_df = employees.join(departments, how="left")
print("\nJoin Result:")
print(joined_df)
```

**Output:** (Same as Left Join)  

---

## **Step 6: Summary of Merge and Join**
| Join Type  | Keeps All Employees? | Keeps All Departments? | Keeps Only Matching Records? |  
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
| Inner Join | ‚ùå No  | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes  |  
| Left Join  | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No  | ‚ùå No  |  
| Right Join | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No  |  
| Outer Join | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No  |  

---

## **Conclusion**
- `merge()` is powerful for SQL-style joins based on columns.
- `.join()` is useful for merging DataFrames using indexes.
- Different join types (inner, left, right, outer) help in various scenarios.
