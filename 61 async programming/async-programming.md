# Asynchronous Programming in Python

Asynchronous programming in Python enables efficient handling of concurrent tasks, particularly for I/O-bound operations like fetching data from websites. This blog explores async programming using Python’s `asyncio` library, with practical examples involving real websites like `codeswithpankaj.com`, `python.org`, and `w3schools.com`. Each topic is explained in depth with code and output.

## 1. Introduction to Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently without blocking, ideal for operations like fetching web pages. Unlike synchronous code, where tasks wait for completion, async code runs tasks in parallel, reducing total execution time.

**Key Terms:**
- **Coroutine**: A function defined with `async def` that can pause and resume.
- **Event Loop**: Manages coroutine execution in `asyncio`.
- **Await**: Pauses a coroutine until a result is ready.
- **Task**: Schedules a coroutine to run in the event loop.

**Example: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Web Fetching**
```python
import time
import requests

# Synchronous
def fetch_page(url):
    print(f"Fetching {url}")
    response = requests.get(url)  # Blocking
    print(f"Fetched {url}")
    return len(response.text)

start = time.time()
urls = ["https://codeswithpankaj.com", "https://python.org", "https://www.w3schools.com"]
for url in urls:
    length = fetch_page(url)
    print(f"{url}: {length} bytes")
print(f"Total time: {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds")
```

Output (example):
```
Fetching https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetched https://codeswithpankaj.com
https://codeswithpankaj.com: 15000 bytes
Fetching https://python.org
Fetched https://python.org
https://python.org: 50321 bytes
Fetching https://www.w3schools.com
Fetched https://www.w3schools.com
https://www.w3schools.com: 45000 bytes
Total time: 2.50 seconds
```

In synchronous code, each request waits for the previous one, taking ~2.5 seconds. Async programming can fetch all pages concurrently.

---

## 2. The `asyncio` Library

The `asyncio` library provides tools for async programming, including an event loop, coroutines, and utilities like `asyncio.gather` for concurrent execution.

### Key Components
- **`asyncio.run()`**: Starts the event loop and runs a coroutine.
- **`async def`**: Defines a coroutine.
- **`await`**: Waits for an awaitable (e.g., coroutine or future).
- **`asyncio.create_task()`**: Schedules a coroutine as a task.
- **`asyncio.gather()`**: Runs multiple coroutines concurrently.

**Example: Async Web Fetching**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import time

async def fetch_page(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        print(f"Fetching {url}")
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            content = await response.text()
            print(f"Fetched {url}")
            return len(content)

async def main():
    urls = ["https://codeswithpankaj.com", "https://python.org", "https://www.w3schools.com"]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*(fetch_page(url) for url in urls))
    for url, length in zip(urls, results):
        print(f"{url}: {length} bytes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    print(f"Total time: {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds")
```

Output (example):
```
Fetching https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetching https://python.org
Fetching https://www.w3schools.com
Fetched https://python.org
Fetched https://www.w3schools.com
Fetched https://codeswithpankaj.com
https://codeswithpankaj.com: 15000 bytes
https://python.org: 50321 bytes
https://www.w3schools.com: 45000 bytes
Total time: 0.80 seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- `aiohttp` is used for async HTTP requests.
- `fetch_page` is a coroutine that fetches a webpage’s content.
- `asyncio.gather` runs all requests concurrently, reducing the total time to ~0.8 seconds (limited by the slowest request).

---

## 3. Coroutines and the `await` Keyword

Coroutines, defined with `async def`, are paused with `await` to allow other tasks to run. Only awaitables (coroutines, tasks, futures) can be awaited.

**Example: Fetch and Process Web Content**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_content(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        print(f"Fetching {url}")
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()

async def count_words(url):
    content = await fetch_content(url)
    word_count = len(content.split())
    print(f"Processed {url}")
    return f"{url}: {word_count} words"

async def main():
    urls = ["https://codeswithpankaj.com", "https://python.org"]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*(count_words(url) for url in urls))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Output (example):
```
Fetching https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetching https://python.org
Processed https://python.org
Processed https://codeswithpankaj.com
https://codeswithpankaj.com: 2000 words
https://python.org: 6000 words
```

**Explanation:**
- `fetch_content` fetches a webpage’s content.
- `count_words` processes the content to count words.
- `await` chains the coroutines, and `asyncio.gather` runs tasks concurrently.

---

## 4. Tasks and Task Scheduling

Tasks schedule coroutines to run concurrently using `asyncio.create_task()`.

**Example: Concurrent Page Fetching with Tasks**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_page(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        print(f"Fetching {url}")
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate delay
            print(f"Fetched {url}")
            return len(await response.text())

async def main():
    urls = ["https://codeswithpankaj.com", "https://www.w3schools.com"]
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch_page(url)) for url in urls]
    print("Tasks scheduled")
    results = await asyncio.wait(tasks)
    for url, task in zip(urls, tasks):
        print(f"{url}: {task.result()} bytes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Output (example):
```
Tasks scheduled
Fetching https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetching https://www.w3schools.com
Fetched https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetched https://www.w3schools.com
https://codeswithpankaj.com: 15000 bytes
https://www.w3schools.com: 45000 bytes
```

**Explanation:**
- `asyncio.create_task` schedules each `fetch_page` coroutine.
- Tasks run concurrently, and `await asyncio.wait` collects results.

---

## 5. Handling Multiple Tasks with `asyncio.gather`

`asyncio.gather` runs coroutines concurrently and returns results in order.

**Example: Fetching Multiple Websites**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_page(url):
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            print(f"Fetching {url}")
            async with session.get(url, timeout=5) as response:
                content = await response.text()
                print(f"Fetched {url}")
                return len(content)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

async def main():
    urls = [
        "https://codeswithpankaj.com",
        "https://python.org",
        "https://www.w3schools.com",
        "https://invalid-site.example"  # Invalid URL
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*(fetch_page(url) for url in urls), return_exceptions=True)
    for url, result in zip(urls, results):
        if isinstance(result, str):
            print(f"Failed to fetch {url}: {result}")
        else:
            print(f"{url}: {result} bytes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Output (example):
```
Fetching https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetching https://python.org
Fetching https://www.w3schools.com
Fetching https://invalid-site.example
Fetched https://python.org
Fetched https://www.w3schools.com
Fetched https://codeswithpankaj.com
Failed to fetch https://invalid-site.example: Cannot connect to host
https://codeswithpankaj.com: 15000 bytes
https://python.org: 50321 bytes
https://www.w3schools.com: 45000 bytes
```

**Explanation:**
- `fetch_page` includes error handling for failed requests.
- `return_exceptions=True` ensures one failure doesn’t stop other tasks.
- The invalid URL fails gracefully, while others succeed.

---

## 6. Error Handling in Async Code

Use try-except blocks or `return_exceptions=True` in `asyncio.gather` to handle errors.

**Example: Handling Fetch Errors**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_page(url, fail=False):
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            print(f"Fetching {url}")
            if fail:
                raise ValueError("Simulated error")
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                return len(await response.text())
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

async def main():
    tasks = [
        fetch_page("https://codeswithpankaj.com"),
        fetch_page("https://python.org", fail=True),
        fetch_page("https://www.w3schools.com")
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    for url, result in zip(["codeswithpankaj.com", "python.org", "w3schools.com"], results):
        if isinstance(result, str):
            print(f"Error for {url}: {result}")
        else:
            print(f"{url}: {result} bytes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Output (example):
```
Fetching https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetching https://python.org
Fetching https://www.w3schools.com
Error for python.org: Simulated error
codeswithpankaj.com: 15000 bytes
w3schools.com: 45000 bytes
```

**Explanation:**
- `fetch_page` simulates an error for `python.org`.
- Errors are caught and returned as strings, allowing other tasks to complete.

---

## 7. Async Context Managers and `async with`

`async with` manages async resources like HTTP sessions.

**Example: Fetching with Context Manager**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_page(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            print(f"Fetched {url}")
            return len(await response.text())

async def main():
    result = await fetch_page("https://codeswithpankaj.com")
    print(f"codeswithpankaj.com: {result} bytes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Output (example):
```
Fetched https://codeswithpankaj.com
codeswithpankaj.com: 15000 bytes
```

**Explanation:**
- `aiohttp.ClientSession` ensures proper session cleanup.
- `async with` handles async resource management.

---

## 8. Practical Use Case: Web Scraping

Async programming excels in web scraping, fetching multiple pages concurrently.

**Example: Scraping Page Titles**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

async def fetch_title(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            html = await response.text()
            soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
            title = soup.title.string if soup.title else "No title"
            print(f"Fetched {url}")
            return f"{url}: {title}"

async def main():
    urls = [
        "https://codeswithpankaj.com",
        "https://python.org",
        "https://www.w3schools.com"
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*(fetch_title(url) for url in urls))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Output (example):
```
Fetched https://codeswithpankaj.com
Fetched https://python.org
Fetched https://www.w3schools.com
https://codeswithpankaj.com: CodesWithPankaj - Learn Programming
https://python.org: Welcome to Python.org
https://www.w3schools.com: W3Schools Online Web Tutorials
```

**Explanation:**
- `BeautifulSoup` extracts page titles.
- `asyncio.gather` fetches pages concurrently, speeding up scraping.

## 9. Best Practices

1. **Use `asyncio.run`**: Start the event loop properly.
2. **Avoid Blocking**: Use `aiohttp` instead of `requests`.
3. **Handle Errors**: Use try-except or `return_exceptions=True`.
4. **Use Async Libraries**: Prefer `aiohttp`, `aiofiles`, etc.
5. **Close Resources**: Use `async with` for sessions.
