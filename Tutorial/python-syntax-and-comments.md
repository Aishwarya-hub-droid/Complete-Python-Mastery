# Python Syntax and Comments

#### Basic Python Syntax and Comments

Welcome to this tutorial on basic Python syntax and comments, designed for students and beginners. This guide is part of the series by **codeswithpankaj** from [www.codeswithpankaj.com](https://www.codeswithpankaj.com).

#### Basic Python Syntax

Understanding the basic syntax of Python is crucial for writing correct and efficient code. Here are some fundamental elements of Python syntax:

**1. Print Statement**

The `print()` function is used to output text or other data to the console.

```python
print("Hello, world!")  # Outputs: Hello, world!
```

**2. Variables and Data Types**

Variables are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, so you do not need to declare the variable type explicitly. Here are some common data types:

```python
# Integer
x = 10

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "codeswithpankaj"

# Boolean
is_active = True
```

**3. Indentation**

Indentation is crucial in Python as it defines the blocks of code. Consistent use of spaces or tabs is required. Python uses indentation to create blocks of code, such as those used in functions, loops, and conditionals.

```python
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is non-positive")
```

#### Comments in Python

Comments are used to explain the code and are ignored by the Python interpreter. They help make the code more readable and maintainable. There are two types of comments in Python: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

**1. Single-Line Comments**

Single-line comments start with a `#`. Everything after the `#` on that line is ignored by the interpreter.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, world!")  # This is an inline comment
```

**2. Multi-Line Comments**

Multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes, either `'''` or `"""`. Although technically these are multi-line strings, they are often used as comments.

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
'''
print("Hello, world!")

"""
This is another way to write
multi-line comments using triple double-quotes.
"""
```

#### Conclusion

Understanding basic Python syntax and how to use comments is essential for writing clear and effective Python code. Comments help explain your code, making it easier to read and maintain.
